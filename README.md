It's powered by react for the interface, Spotify API for finding and playing podcasts, and the Web Speech API for voice controls.

## Available Commands
**chatterbox pause** - pauses the playback

**chatterbox play** - resumes playback

**chatterbox next** or **chatterbox skip** - goes to the next podcast in queue

**chatterbox back** or **chatterbox previous** - goes to the previous podcast in queue

**chatterbox genre \[genre\]** - plays and queues podcasts of the given genre
